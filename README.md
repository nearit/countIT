# CountIT

A [howmanypeoplearearound](https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound) inspired tool.

This tool generates reports containing the detections details (scan time interval, `device_id` and `rssi` and `mac` address of each detection) and uploads them to a S3 bucket.

***Note***: It may be illegal to monitor networks for MAC addresses, especially on networks that *you do not own*. Please check your country's laws (for US [Section 18 U.S. Code ยง 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511)) - [discussion](https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound/issues/4).

## Requirements

* Raspberry Pi
* Monitor mode enabled WiFi adapter

(Tested with [Alfa AWUS036NHA](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NHA-Wireless-USB-Adaptor/dp/B004Y6MIXS) adapter)

## Setup

### Install tshark

```sh
sudo apt-get install tshark
```

Let tshark be run as non-root:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common     (select YES)
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark ${USER:-root}
newgrp wireshark
```

### Configuration

Once you have a configured RPi with a monitor-mode enabled WiFi adapter, you will need to install requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are experiencing some installation issue, be sure to have `python-dev` installed:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-dev
```

Then you'll need to define a configuration. Place a `config.json` file at the root folder with this structure (replacing the placeholders):

```json
{
    "scan_time": 1200,
    "max_rssi": -70,
    "upload_frequency": "hourly",
    "bucket_name": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
    "compression_type": "gzip",
    "compress_in_memory": true,
    "env": "dev",
    "customer": "CUSTOMER_NAME",
    "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
}
```

In order to successfully upload trackings to your S3 bucket, you must have AWS credentials in your RPi.

Run the following command

```sh
nano ~/.aws/credentials
```

and paste the structure below, fill in the placeholders and save it (`ctrl+x`, insert `y` and then press enter)

```text
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Test the tool

To test this tool just run

```sh
python countit.py
```

## Deploy the tool

Just run the setup, it will automagically schedule runs and uploads.

```sh
sudo python setup.py
```

_`sudo` is required to create log file in `/var/log/` and to change its permissions_

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing some strange behavior, scan or upload failures, check the log file `/var/log/countit.log` to identify the issue.
